  The goal is to cover subjects that will be appealing across different disciplines. Technical or business-focused, environmental or social, new or old, complex or simple‚ as long as the ideas are interesting and you find them amazing, they’ll fit right in.
  
%p Here's just a handful of topics that have been covered in previous events:

%ul
  %li Mass Collaboration, Free Information and the Semantic Web
  %li Complexity and Chaos
  %li Integenerational Learning
  %li Wine Tasting
  %li The Future of Health
  %li How to Juggle

%h2 The Format

%p The day at Trampoline is filled with sessions offered by attendees on the day - nothing is given priority, nothing is locked in before we start. Each session is 20 minutes long, and is focused on sharing something that the presenter finds amazing. Sometimes they can be talks, or group discussions, or tutorials. You can structure your session how you wish.

%p There's no expectation that those speaking are experts (though a little knowledge usually helps). <strong>Participation is key</strong>.

%p At any given point, there will be four or five sessions happening - so you can either choose one discussion, or wander between a few - there's no expectation to stay put.

%h2 Getting Involved

%p All the conversations around Trampoline don't stop once the day is over - they continue online via <a href="http://twitter.com/trampolineday">Twitter</a> and <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/trampoline-melb>the Google Group</a>.

%p The latter in particular is a great way to communicate with many Trampoline attendees - perhaps following up on topics that were discussed, sharing further ideas, or putting together ideas for the next event.
